# Bridge-NN
* Trained a neural network to play Double Dummy (perfect information) Bridge in the model of the Alpha Zero paper
* Implemented algorithm in Python, switched over to Julia framework/library in order to increase speed and efficiency to undergo the necessary amount of training
* In the process of augmenting the algorithm to handle imperfect information to train an agent to play the full Bridge game
